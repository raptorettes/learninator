<hr/><p>There is no beauty without darkness. There is much darkness without beauty. Not because it isn&#39;t there - it never was; we invented it to make the darkness less lonely, to provide a light for hope to huddle around. There are some things we just can&#39;t reconcile, relate to self, consider as necessary for the continuance of the view we have to hold of ourselves to continue to be, survive, eke out our existences.</p>
<p>Within each of us lie the same seeds that made those we consider great; the same seeds that made those we consider terrible. I find many of these to be the same sparks, the fires they ignite both awesome, and awful - nothing I strive for is fuelled by peace, or contentment; more often than not, my laudable actions are the result of rage, depression, disgust and envy. </p>
<p>Through the years, I&#39;ve sought to contain the worst, to hold the darkness nascent within me, to pack away the pains with which life paves my path. From the earliest, the world tormented me, with its nonsensical, self-destructive ways, the blitheness of humanity in the face of the overwhelming insanity that is simply existing, its pedestrian denial of the magnitude of its own potentials, the stubborn persistence of ignorance and mediocrity despite the brightest and best chance we have of making a tolerable, tolerant world lying in the very minds around us. The ability we all have to feel alone, abandoned, empty, in the veritable sea of human flesh and mind.</p>
<p>The sight of it, its pointlessness, it&#39;s ugliness, grew clearer and clearer for me as I began puberty&#39;s hormonal tempest of growth. By 14, I&#39;d found myself consistently arriving at the singular conclusion that the strain of attempting to ignore everything I knew innately, so as to interact with the other beings of this planet was too much. That no other could possibly share that sight. I knew I could not alone - that my psyche would bend, and bend, and bend, and break, that whatever I was would cease to be, that I would lose. Lose my self, my will, dignity, purpose, compassion and capacity to care. I resolved again and again that there was nothing for me here, never could be. That death, now, was the only peace I might ever have.</p>
<p>And I cried. For months. I cried tears, and I cried screams, I opened my mouth on rooftops and drank the night rain in gasping sobs, I choked and spluttered, and I fought back. </p>
<p>I had but one light. Something more than love. Compassion, empathy. I lived, not because I could bear the pain, but because I knew others couldn&#39;t. That dying, and staying alive was the only peace I could give others. And there, crying for my yet-unloved self, crying for the gift that none knew I gave, crying for the pain I&#39;d accepted as mine, dying inside for the same; there - my journey began.</p>
<p>Later, I&#39;d come to call this virtue. That I&#39;d define selflessness as both impossible, and the single redeeming value anyone might have. Later still, I&#39;d realise that more than anything my selflessness served a selfish purpose - I did not feed my psyche, refused to reward it, that I&#39;d act in any way possible, simply to avoid it being present. It&#39;s grown in the dark. Despised, and disgusted with itself, with its shell, and the world that shell lopes about in. It is a thing of the darkness, cut from the same cloth as the voids, and like them, more potent than any thing contained within it. Here, inside me, is a beast made of rage, pain, and awe, of the very same irreconcilable insanity of existence. It is dangerous, and I keep it at bay, by being a creature of thoughts, logics, abstractions. Anything but feelings. Should I care about another, should I care about myself, they will hurt. And I will find pain, and pain is the hold that that self has over me. A hold no leash can restrain, a potency I cannot justify, predict, or contain. It is a wild wolf, streaking towards its kill, death warm in its mouth, it is a star going nova, it is a caldera tearing open and breaching the sky.</p>
<p>I fear it; I hide from it, hide it from me, hide it from others, lest they see. Lest they fear me too, and I have to look again. </p>
<p>I&#39;ve been abused, raped. beaten, shot at, stabbed, imprisoned, robbed. I have seen men bleed to death, their skulls broken or practically bisected, babies still born, men starving amidst plenty. The innocents I love have had their innocence torn from them by abusers, and others I&#39;ve loved have been taken by disease, by addictions, and by violence. I&#39;ve been beaten by those I love more than by those I haven&#39;t, repetitively had years of my life erased, rendered pointless; years of my works, my words, my music, my art, destroyed vindictively, viciously, often violently. And I give. And I give. Give still, because I cannot fight others. This city is under siege from within, and no outside threat is its equal. I&#39;ve stared death in the face with complacency, and I stare at life with ever fresh horror. Close mind, open eyes, continue. Breathe. Mind, mind, mind. This mind is my wall, the perch from which I see the ruin below on either side. It&#39;s a fragile perch, and the wall is tremoring, bombarded and assaulted every moment. I fall, often. Sometimes inside, sometimes without - always into pain.</p>
<p>Yet for all the gifts I believe I give, none has borne happiness, none brought light to me. I have either faltered, and dropped precious cargo, or others have torn it from me, and smashed my gifts, my trust, my care, my hope, my compassion.</p>
<p>But I have nothing else. Nothing else between me and the darkness.</p>
